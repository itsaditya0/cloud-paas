In a small, isolated village, there was a house that had been abandoned for decades. The locals avoided it, whispering tales of the strange occurrences that had plagued it years before. 

One rainy night, a young woman named Clara, curious and unafraid, decided to explore the house. She had always been fascinated by the paranormal and wanted to experience it for herself. With a flashlight in hand and a camera around her neck, she pushed open the creaky door and stepped inside.

The air was musty, and the floors groaned under her weight. She made her way through the dusty rooms, taking pictures of the old furniture and peeling wallpaper. As she reached the top of the staircase, she noticed an old, ornate mirror hanging at the end of the hall. The mirror’s surface was covered in grime, but Clara could still make out her reflection, framed by the dim light of her flashlight.

She approached the mirror, wiping away some of the dirt with her sleeve. As she did, she noticed something odd. Her reflection was slightly out of sync, moving just a fraction of a second behind her movements. Clara frowned and took a step back, trying to shake off the unsettling feeling.

That’s when she saw it. In the reflection, behind her, a shadowy figure began to emerge. It was tall and indistinct, its form wavering like smoke. Clara spun around, but the hallway was empty. Her heart pounded as she looked back at the mirror. The figure was now closer, its eyes dark voids staring directly at her.

Panicked, Clara turned and fled down the stairs, but the floor seemed to stretch endlessly, and the walls closed in around her. She stumbled and fell, her flashlight flickering. The shadows around her grew longer, and the whispering voices of the village's old tales filled her ears.

When Clara finally reached the front door, she yanked it open and burst into the rain, gasping for breath. She glanced back at the house, and through the rain-smeared window, she saw the mirror’s reflection once more. The figure was now right behind her, its hand reaching out from the glass.

Clara ran without looking back, but as she reached her car and looked in the rearview mirror, she saw it again—the figure’s cold, empty eyes staring back at her. She drove away as fast as she could, but the image stayed with her, haunting her dreams and waking hours.

No one ever saw Clara again. The house remained abandoned, but the mirror was said to have a new, chilling addition: a photograph of Clara’s terrified face, trapped forever behind its glass, next to the shadowy figure that had claimed her.
